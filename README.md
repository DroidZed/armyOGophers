### Learning project

I'm making this CLI app as a learning project to understand and
learn the Go Programming Language better.

Currently, nothing is implemented aside from OS info and CPU Arch.

Feel free to build it with:

```sh
go build -o bin/armyOGophers.exe
```

For now, I can only do it on Windows, but will improve it and make it
Unix friendly.
